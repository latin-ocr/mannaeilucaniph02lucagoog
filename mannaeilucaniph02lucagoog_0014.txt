THIS little volume, prepared as an experiment, needs
no presace. The Editors have had before them the
editions of Oudendorp Weber and Weise, with several
others ior occasional reference. But the notes are in
the main their own, and have been written by them

in concert, Mr Haskins supplying the bulk os the

matter, and prefixing thereto a chronological table

and an abstract os the contents of the book. Mr
Heitland has supplied the lite ol Lucan and remarks

on the Pharsalia which form the Introduction, and

has also made an Index to the notes, It may be

added that brevity has been studied throughout. ,

Caunnmen, May 1875.

Β. Manner of tlte Poem.

Quintilian¹ happily remarks: ‘Lucan lias in him a tire and
‘vehemence and sparkles with epigram: in fact, to speak my
‘mind os him, he is rather a model for the orator than the poet!
These lew thoughtsul words exhaust the merits os Lucan’s style,
and indicate his true place in Roman literature. Helacked the
power ol imagination needlul lor the production of really poetic
narrative; instead os giving a master-touch to an ordinary
statement, and thereby making it his own lor ever, he states
the fact baldly, or gives it an unnatural prominence by means
os tiresome repetition or gross exaggeration. We may well
suspect that even had he been imaginative in a high sense he
would still have been slovenly. For as we find in him none ol ·
the delicate taste in description which we admire in Virgil, so
we are sensible os a monotony in his lines strikingly opposed to
the variety oi pauses and free use ol elision which aid the rhyth-
mic movement ol the Aeneid. There are two pauses ol which
Lucan is particularly fond: one is that at the penthemimeral
caesura after a weak caesura in the second l'oot¹; the other at
the hephthemimeral, after a weak one in the third foot³. He
avoids the use ol lines with abnormal caesura, such as Virgil
employs with marked effect; elisions too and spondaic endings
are rare in his verses. The uniformity produced by such ad-
herence to a l'ew models renders his narrative generally dull, even
in parts where the matter possesses a genuine interest os its own:
but in the speeches which he puts into the mouths ol his
characters we leel the monotony less, as we are borne along in
the lull swing of his declamatoryvehemence, and enlivened with
a succession ol short stinging epigrams (sententiae) which strike
home and fix themselves in the reader's memory. Our own
literature reminds us that the death ol imagination is likely to

be the birth of epigram: but there was something more than

THE PHARSAL'IA. xiii

the taste of his day that gave this turn to the style ot' Lucan.
He was brought up with the short and pithy sayings of the
Stoics ever in his ears, and no doubt much is to be set down to
their effect, not only ou his thoughts but also on the somnos
their expression. llere was an influence to act as a counter-
poise to the rhetoric oi the Schools. From this singularly sen·
tentious brevity Lucan is like Horace most apt sor quotation,
but with an important difference in the purposes for which he
may be quoted; there is in his sayings an eamestness and
moral grandeur to which the pleasure-loving satirist never
rises: it may perhaps be more correct to say that Lucan is
himself in this respect a satirist, but os another mould than
Horace. His spirit is more nearly akin to that ofJuvenal. But
while noticing the pungent sarcasm which relieves the decla-
matory flow os the Pharsalia, we must not sorget the tedious
descriptions¹ os places, tribes, military operations‚ prodigies
priestly and mystic uites, witchcrait‚ &c.‚ &c.‚ in minute detail;
matters unimportant in themselves, aud serving only to impede
and obscure the action os the poem. But the false taste which

caused these to be inserted is not to be set down wholly as .

Lucan’s; it was the taste os the (lay. This was an ageos com-

pilations and common-place books, in a word, the age oi Ι

the elder Pliny author os the ‘Natural History’. Instead os
blaming Lucan ior putting in these tiresome passages we
ought perhaps rather to be thankiul that there are not more

of them, that he has not shewn himself more encyclopaedic and
less epigrammatical.

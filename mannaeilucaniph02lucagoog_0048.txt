LlFE OF LUCAN. vii

lapsed. Among the first taken was Lucan, and to him as to
others false offers of forgiveness were addressed in order to ,
extort from him the names of accomplices. Here the young
poet failed to act up to his Stoic training¹: under the fear of
death his constancy gave way, and after holding out for a while
he charged his own mother Acilia with a share in the plot.

But neither this nor a string of confessions² which followed
could save him: he was soon like the rest condemned to die,
the mode of death being left to his own choice. Accordingly
he nerved himself for his end, went into ahot bath and had
his veins opened³: there he calmly bled to death in the same
way as many other Romans of mark did in those days of
tyranny when suicide was the only refuge from despair. While
the life-blood ran from him he is said to have repeated aloud
some appropriate lines from his own great poem (tx. 811-814):

sanguis eraut lacrimae: quaecunque foramina novit
humor, ab his largus manat cruor: ora redundant
et patulae nares: sudor rubet: omnia plenis
membra fluunt venis: totum est pro vulnere corpus.

Thus died Lucam and his uncle Seneca and his father Mela‘
were involved in the same ruin. His wife, the beautiful and
virtuous Polla Argentarial to whom he had been tenderly
attached, survived him many years: and to her were addressed
in mernory of her husband some short epigrams of Martial‚ and
the long and over-drawn panegyric of Statius,

Viewing the events of Lucan's life as a whole we may fairly
point to the life uf Naevius as in many respects parallel. The
earlier poet sang of the first Punic war, in which he had when
a youth taken part; the young enthusiast of the deeadenee
tells of the great civil struggle just past, the effects of which
were still felt and seen: bold in the choice of a main subject,
both handled it with a vigour for which they likewise found

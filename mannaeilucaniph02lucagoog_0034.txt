THE PHARSALIA. xiii

the taste oi his day that gave this turn to the style of Lucan.
He was brought up with the short and pithy sayings of the
Stoics ever in his ears, and no doubt much is to be set down to
their effect, not only on his thoughtS, but also on the formos
their expression. Here was an influence to act as a counter·
poise to the rhetoric os the Schools. From this singularly sen·
tentious brevity Lucan is like Horace most apt lor quotation,
hut with an important difference in the purposes sor which he
may be quoted; there is in his sayings an earnestness and
moral grandeur to which the pleasure·loving satirist never
rises: it may perhaps be more correct to say that Lucan is
himself in this respecta satirist, but ol another mould than
Horace. His spirit is more nearly akin to that oi Juvenal But
while noticing the pungent sarcasm which relieves the decla·
matory flow os the Pharsalia, we must not forget the tedious
descriptions¹ ol placeS, tribes, military operations, prodigies,
priestly and mystic rites, witchcralt, &c., duc, in minute detail;
matters uuimportant in themselves, and serving only to impede
and obscure the action ol the poem. But the false taste which

caused these to be inserted is not to be set down wholly as .

Lucan’s; it was the taste ol the day. This was an ageos com·

pilatious and common-place books, in a word, the age of Δ

the elder Pliny author of the ‘Natural History'. Instead of
blaming Lucan for putting in these tiresome passages, we
ought perhaps rather to be thankful that there are not more

of them, that he has not shewn himself more encyclopaedic and
less epigrammatical.
